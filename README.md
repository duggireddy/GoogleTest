# GoogleTest
The Google Test/ gtest/ gmock is based on the xUnit Architecture of building Unit test code. It is portable and reusable, with this we can utilize the code works on Linux, Mac, and Windows. C++ Language is employed to construct the unit Tests and all the name conventions, functions, scope rules are applicable to write the unit test code in Google Test.

# Test Fixtures
Test Fixture: Using the same Data Configuration for Multiple Test{#same-data-multiple-tests}.if we are writing more tests that operate on similar data, we can use a test fixture.This allows you to reuse the ssame configuration of objects for several different tests.

# Google Mock
When we write a prototype or test, often it’s not feasible or wise to rely on real objects entirely. A mock object implements the same interface as a real object (so it can be used as one).

# Unit testing 
Tests are carried out on specific units of a program to see whether they are functioning properly or not as part of software development and testing is called Unit testing

# Test Cases
Test is written by the Capital letter “TEST” and it takes the two parameters same as like functions. The first parameter is a test name and within that test, the second parameter is subtest. We can have the n-number of subtests under the test name, like sub_test1, sub_test2 etc
